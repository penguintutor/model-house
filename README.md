# Model House
Source code for controlling lighting and smoke generator for a model house. This is based on a building for a g-scale model railway.

Technically this is actually a weigh bridge building, but for the displays this has been demonstrated as though it is a house. The [model railway building is designed in FreeCAD and 3D printed](http://www.penguintutor.com/projects/gscalebuilding1).

## Christmas House

The christmas-house directory contains the files for a Pygame Zero version of the model house. 
This is based around a [Raspberry Pi HAT PCB created in Fritzing](http://www.penguintutor.com/electronics/design-fritzing). 

The program runs directly on the host computer with a [graphical interface created in Pygame Zero which can turn the LEDs on and off](http://www.penguintutor.com/projects/christmas-house). 

## ESP32

I've also created a version using client server technology based around an ESP32 and a Raspberry Pi. See the project page of the [ESP32 version of the model house lighting](http://www.penguintutor.com/projects/esp32-wireless-house).
